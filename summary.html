  <h1>Summary of how web browsers and web servers works</h1>
  <h2>Web browser</h2>
  <p>
    You run a web client on your computer (called a web browser) such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer or Firefox. That client contacts a web server and requests information or resources.
    <br>The web server locates and then sends the information to the web browser, which displays the results.
    <p>
      When web browsers contact servers, they’re asking to be sent pages built with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Browsers interpret those pages and display them on your computer.
      <br>They also can display applications, programs, animations, and similar material created with programming languages such as Java and ActiveX, scripting languages such as JavaScript, and techniques such as AJAX.
    </p>
  </p>
  <h2>Web server</h2>
  <p>
    A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP, the basic network protocol used to distribute information on the World Wide Web.
    <br>The term can refer to the entire system, or specifically to the software that accepts and supervises the HTTP requests.
    <br>
    <p>
      Browser Resolves the Domain Name to an IP Address. Your web browser first needs to know which IP address the domain name www.quackit.com resolves to.
      <br>If it doesn't already have this information stored in it's cache, it requests the information from one or more DNS servers (via the internet).
      <br>The DNS server tells the browser which IP address the domain name resolves to (and therefore, where the website is located).
